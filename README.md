## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- **OpenAPI JSON**: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** or later
- **PostgreSQL 13** or later
- **Gradle 8.x** (wrapper included)
- **Google OAuth2 credentials** (for social login)
- **SMTP server** (for email functionality)

### Environment Variables

Before running the server, set up the following environment variables:

```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET_BASE_64=your_base64_encoded_jwt_secret

# Email Configuration
GMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

# OAuth2 Configuration
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
OAUTH2_SECRET=your_google_oauth_secret
```

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemang-mishra/Jagrati-backend.git
cd Jagrati-backend
```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL Database**
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE jagrati_db;

-- Create user (optional)
CREATE USER jagrati_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE jagrati_db TO jagrati_user;
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
```bash
# Option 1: Export in terminal
export JWT_SECRET_BASE_64="your_jwt_secret"
export DB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jagrati_db"
# ... other variables

# Option 2: Create .env file (if supported)
# Option 3: Set in IDE run configuration
```

4. **Build and Run**
```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the application
./gradlew bootRun
```

5. **Verify Installation**
- Server should start on `http://localhost:8080`
- Check health endpoint: `GET /actuator/health`
- Access API docs: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

### Database Migration

The application uses Spring Boot's automatic schema generation. On first run:
- Tables will be created automatically based on JPA entities
- Initial data seeding may be required for roles and permissions
- Check application logs for any migration issues


## Architecture

The server follows modern Spring Boot practices:

- **Layered Architecture**: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository
- **RESTful API Design**: Resource-based URLs with proper HTTP methods
- **Security**: JWT-based stateless authentication
- **Database**: JPA with PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI specifications
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
