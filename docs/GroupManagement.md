### **👥 Group Management in Jagruti**

**Overview:**
In Jagruti, students are grouped not strictly by academic class, but by learning level and conceptual understanding. This allows more personalized, flexible education. Students are assigned to **named groups** based on their proficiency, such as Group A, B, C, Class 9–10, or Nabodha for competitive prep.

### **📚 Group Structure:**

* **Groups Are Concept-Based:**
  Designed to cluster students by their actual grasp of subjects rather than school grade.

* **Group Examples:**

  * **Group A:** Students comfortable with class 1–4 content.
  * **Group B / C:** Higher foundational level students.
  * **Class 9–10 Group:** Advanced curriculum.
  * **Nabodha:** Special track for competitive exam preparation (11–12 level).

Want to define how deleted groups should be handled? Like maybe mark them “inactive” instead of hard deleting?
