Idea of admin/super admin panel: For certain screens, admins or super admins may have more access.
So instead of coding/designing the entire screen again for them, we will have an extra section below or above every screen which is shown with extra options related to that particular feature.

Volunteer access level:
* User Profile (for new users who are not volunteers yet)

* Volunteer list (maybe integrate with ranking)
* Volunteer search (or maybe a common search for both students and volunteers)
* Volunteer profile(other volunteer) (Delete volunteer option for super admins)
* My Profile (of the user)
* Edit profile (by the user itself)
* Student Profile. (delete student option for super-admins only)
* Student Group transitions (showing how a student's group has changed overtime, kind of we can relate to student progress)
*


Permission requried: (They won't be part of the main app, kind of a separate section of the app, figma design not required.)
* Add roles
* Add permission
* Manage people with roles (assign role to people)
* Manage role and permissions
* View role transitions (Just cannot change super-admins)
* Volunteer requests section (approve+view)

* Add group
* Remove group
* Add/Remove Villages
* Register/Edit student (people with adequate permission)
