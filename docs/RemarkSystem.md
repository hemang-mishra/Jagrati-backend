Perfect, that rounds out the remark system really well. Here's a clear structure for how **remarks** will work in Jagrati:

---

### 📝 **Student Remarks System**

**Purpose:**
To keep a trackable, collaborative log of volunteer observations, both academic and behavioral, directly on a student's profile.

---

### 📌 **Core Fields for a Remark:**

* **Remark ID** – unique identifier for the remark
* **Student ID** – the student the remark is about
* **Volunteer ID** – the volunteer who gave the remark
* **Date** – timestamp when the remark was created
* **Description** – full text of the remark
* **Topic/Subtopic ID** *(optional)* – link to a specific academic concept if it’s curriculum-based
* **Type** – defines the nature of the remark:

  * Academic (proficiency-related)
  * Behavioral
  * Parent-related
  * Miscellaneous

---

### 👍👎 **Engagement:**

* Other volunteers can **upvote or downvote** remarks
* This gives visibility into which remarks are widely agreed upon or disagreed with

---

### 👀 **Visibility:**

* All remarks appear on the **student profile**
* Can be filtered by type or relevance

---

This gives a very rich picture of the student’s development from both academic and social angles. Would you want a way to resolve or archive old remarks too?
