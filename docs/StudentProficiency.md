Awesome, you've built a pretty intelligent and adaptive way to track learning! Here's a full summary of the **Student Proficiency Tracking** system you‚Äôve described:

### **üìä Student Proficiency Tracking**

**Overview:**
This system measures how well a student understands a particular topic or sub-topic. Instead of being manually entered, the proficiency is **calculated** dynamically based on input from various learning activities like tests or assignments. It helps in identifying whether a student needs revision, is average, or is confident in a given concept.

---

### **üìà Proficiency Scale:**

* **Scale:**

  * **Range:** From 1.00 to 10.00 (up to two decimal places).
  * **NULL:** Indicates the topic hasn't been taught or assessed yet.

* **Categories (based on the score):**

  * **Not Taught:** No data yet; remains NULL.
  * **Poor:** 1.00 to 3.99
  * **Average:** 4.00 to 6.99
  * **Good:** 7.00 to 10.00

*(Exact category cutoffs can be adjusted later if needed.)*

### **üß† Tracking Unit:**

Still under consideration ‚Äî whether to track proficiency **per topic** or **per sub-topic**.
You may go with sub-topic if granularity is more useful, or topic-level for broader tracking.

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Proficiency Calculation Formula:**

Whenever a new observation (like a test or remark) is made, proficiency is updated using a **weighted formula**:

`New Proficiency = (w √ó New Score) + ((1 - w) √ó Old Proficiency)`

* **New Score:** The score the student received in the recent activity for that topic.
* **Old Proficiency:** Their previous recorded proficiency.
* **w (Weight):** Represents how reliable the method is.

  * Example:

    * A well-designed test ‚Üí w = 0.9 (very accurate)
    * An informal homework check ‚Üí w = 0.3 (less accurate)
    * A perfect evaluation ‚Üí w = 1.0 (fully replaces old score)

This ensures that more reliable assessments influence proficiency more strongly, while weaker signals have less impact.

---

### **üí° Future Considerations:**

* **Remark System:**
  A lightweight way to let volunteers log informal observations (like via homework), which could contribute to proficiency with lower weight.
