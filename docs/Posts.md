Posts Feature Description

The Posts feature in Jagrati serves as a simple and engaging way to share updates, highlights, and announcements within the organization. Each post is created by a volunteer and can include the following:

Description: A text body describing the post, written by the volunteer.

Image IDs: Multiple images can be attached to a post. These are stored separately and linked using their IDs.

Posted By: The volunteer ID of the person who created the post.

Timestamp: The exact time when the post was created.

Likes: Users can like a post. There are no dislikes or comments to keep the interaction light and focused.

Category (Optional): A post can be optionally categorized using an enum to help organize and filter them. Possible categories include:

STUDENT_ACHIEVEMENT

EVENT

GENERAL



This structure keeps the experience simple and flexible, while still allowing Jagrati to showcase important moments and recognize contributions.
