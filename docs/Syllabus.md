Hereâ€™s a structured and clear documentation draft for the **Syllabus Management** feature, based fully on what you shared:

### **ðŸ“˜ Syllabus Management**

**Overview:**
This feature allows for flexible, scalable management of the educational syllabus, spanning from class 1 to class 12. The structure supports organizing subjects, topics, and sub-topics, along with linking educational resources and maintaining session-friendly content.

---

### **ðŸ§± Syllabus Structure:**

* **Class Level:**

  * Represents the grade (currently designed for classes 1 to 12).
  * Should be flexible â€” classes can be added dynamically.

* **Subjects under each Class:**

  * Examples: Hindi, English, Maths, Mental Ability, etc.
  * This should also remain flexible to allow addition/removal of subjects.

* **Titles (Topics) under each Subject:**

  * These are the chapter-level divisions, like "Arithmetic" or "Algebra".
  * Each title represents a broader area of the subject.

* **Sub-topics under each Title:**

  * These are atomic concepts designed to be taught in a single session (typically 1 hour).
  * Each sub-topic includes:

    * **Name:** Concise and session-oriented.
    * **Description:** Brief explanation of the sub-topic content.
    * **Resources (optional):**

      * Links related to that sub-topic or topic.
      * A short description for each link (e.g., "Introductory video on fractions").

* **Resource Flexibility:**

  * Resources can be linked either directly to a **topic** or to a **sub-topic**, depending on relevance.

---

### **Design Principles:**

* Keep structure **modular** and **scalable**.
* Ensure **session-level granularity** for sub-topics.
* Allow flexible addition of new classes, subjects, or sub-topics without altering the core schema.
