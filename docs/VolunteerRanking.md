That’s a really solid, fair system — tracks effort transparently while leaving room for flexibility. Here’s how I’d document the **Volunteer Ranking System** for Jagrati:

---

### **🏆 Volunteer Ranking & Activity Tracking**

**Overview:**
To recognize and encourage consistent contribution, Jagrati maintains a **point-based ranking system** for volunteers. Activities performed by volunteers are logged and scored, which then determine their overall standing in the platform.

---

### **📌 Types of Activities Tracked:**

1. **Class Attendance:**

   * A volunteer being **present** in a teaching session (whether leading or assisting).

2. **Homework Checking:**

   * Reviewing students' homework and providing feedback or remarks.

3. **Teaching & Homework Assignment:**

   * Being one of the **primary volunteers** teaching a session and assigning classwork/homework.

4. **Miscellaneous Activities:**

   * Special contributions that don’t fit in regular teaching tasks, like:

     * Organizing or leading events
     * Coordinating outreach
     * Content creation or app feedback

---

### **🔢 Scoring System:**

* Each activity type is assigned **specific points** (defined in the backend or settings).
* The volunteer's **total score** is a sum of all these activity points.
* **Admins** (or super admins) can adjust scoring rules over time.

---

### **📝 Miscellaneous Activity Logging (Admin-Only):**

* **What It Is:** A flexible way to reward special efforts.
* **How It Works:**
  Admins can:

  * Add a **description** of the task.
  * Assign it to one or more volunteers.
  * **Set custom point value** for that task.

---

### **🎯 Purpose:**

* Promotes fairness and transparency
* Encourages consistent involvement
* Helps in identifying and rewarding active, dependable volunteers
