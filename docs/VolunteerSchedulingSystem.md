Alright, that adds a very important layer to volunteer coordination. Here's how this **Volunteer Schedule System** would be structured and controlled in Jagrati:

---

### 🗓️ **Volunteer Scheduling System**

**Purpose:**
To organize teaching duties clearly, based on availability, expertise, and group requirements.

---

### 🔧 **Core Structure:**

Each **volunteer schedule entry** includes:

* **Day of the Week** – like Monday, Tuesday, etc.
* **Group** – for example, Group A, Group B, etc.
* **Subject** – like Math, English, Science, etc.

A volunteer can have **multiple such entries**, and it's perfectly okay for them to not have any (inactive volunteers or floaters).

---

### 🔐 **Access & Permissions:**

* **Admins only** can add, edit, or delete schedule entries.
* **Volunteers** can submit requests (maybe from their profile or schedule tab) to:

  * Add a new day
  * Change their subject
  * Modify group assignment

These requests could show up for admin approval.

---

### 👤 **Where It's Shown:**

* On the **Volunteer Profile** page:

  * Display this as a weekly table or list
  * Helps everyone know what they’re expected to do and when

---

This keeps the flow tight while giving flexibility. Want me to help sketch how the request and approval system could work?
